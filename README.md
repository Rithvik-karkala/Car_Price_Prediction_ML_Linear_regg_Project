In this project on car price prediction, I employed the machine learning algorithm known as linear regression to develop a predictive model. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

The objective of my project was to predict the price of a car based on various features or independent variables. Initially, I started with a single independent variable, considering factors such as Fuel capacity vs. price. As the project progressed, I expanded the scope by incorporating multiple independent variables, including model year, Owners, Mileage, Length, and fuel efficiency. This expansion allowed for a more comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing car prices.

The accuracy of the predictive model was a crucial metric to evaluate its performance. I utilized various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared, to quantify the model's ability to make accurate predictions. Through iterative refinement and parameter tuning, I aimed to enhance the model's precision and reliability.

In conclusion, my project delved into applying linear regression in predicting car prices, evolving from a single-variable approach to a more sophisticated model with multiple independent variables. This endeavor not only provided hands-on experience with machine learning but also emphasized the importance of accurate model evaluation in ensuring the effectiveness of predictive algorithms.
